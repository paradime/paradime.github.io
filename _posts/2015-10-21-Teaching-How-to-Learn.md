title: Learning How to Teach with JQuery
---

Recently I gave a presentation at The Ohio State University's Collegiate Web
Developer Club on JQuery. This has been one of the first times that I've been in
the front of a class instead of sitting in its seats. It was quite an odd
experience and I can now empathize with my prior teachers. Getting a room of 15
students to focus and pay attention to what you have to say can be extremely
daunting. However, I recently took a class on [Learning how to
learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on Coursera and I
tried to apply some of the techniques that I learned in the class to my
presentation in the classroom.

## Drawing them in
I found that there's a difference between handing students the information and
making them want the information. I'm sure that not everyone walked in to that
classroom and was really excited to learn about the ins and outs of JQuery. This
is where credibility comes in. Building this is different for your audience. A
group of college students are going to be more interested in an entertaining or
funny lecture than a group of colleagues. I will say that some techniques are
universal. Humor, analogies, and mental hooks can really aid in getting the
audience's attention. On a recent [snap
judgment](https://soundcloud.com/snapjudgment/joyce-lee-dropping-the-ball?in=snapjudgment/sets/brass-ring)
I heard Joyce Lee, a high school teacher, integrated the analysis of Lil
Wayne's rap lyrics into her critical thinking lecture. To a group of
professionals, this would seem like a less than ideal example but it pulled in
her demographic. 

For my talk, I tried to throw in both humor and analogies. Have you ever heard
someone tell a joke that you didn't get and then ask them to explain it? The
need to understand it is insatiable. I started off with a pun. 'Put your $ where
your mouth is' and then said 'if you get this, you can leave.'(a trick that I
learned from a college professor) This got people that understood the joke
laughing and got the other students interested in finding out what the joke was
about. At the end I threw a similar pun out there 'Show me the $' where I asked
the students to start one of the exercises. Everyone felt included in the end
and it dropped a mental hook that $ === JQuery. 

## Metaphors to create hooks
I also included a home brewed metaphor in how I understood JQuery. Think of it
like a play. You need 3 things:

1. A stage, actors, and actresses (HTML)
2. Costumes, makeup, and placement (CSS)
3. A script that includes stage direction (JQuery)

I know it's not a perfect analogy but it gets the job done. From there we dove
deeper
into what was included in a script. 

1. The paper itself ($)
2. The actor or actress ('selector')
3. The action for them to take or what they should say (action)

This bundles nicely into the syntax for JQuery, ```$('selector').action()```

From there, the most complicated thing to explain is selectors. JQuery does the
heavy lifting for you for that one. Since it's based on CSS selectors, just let
them know that they can use their knowledge (or mental hook) that they have from
CSS to find the HTML elements. 

Everything wraps up into that nice package where each topic smoothly leads into
each other.

## Teamwork is an education enhancing drug
One of the biggest problems that I've had when trying to learn something is I
can't remember what I actually learned as soon as I walk out of the classroom.
At this club meeting, we had an activity immediately afterwards where myself and
another [mentor](http://j3rn.com/) were available to help answer any questions
that came up. I threw in another twist here where I had the students pair up.
Pairing is great when you're learning something with someone else. It can get
you out of [einstellung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect) when
you get two different perspectives. In addition, you're both 'in the shits'
together and are more likely to ask for help. 

Finally, the one critique on the CWDG of Ohio State would be to have the
students work on a small project over the course of the semester. Web
development is so large, they could do anything from 'copy a website' to come up
with their own. This takes everything that they've learned in the club and let
them create practical applications that are all student driven, not required.
