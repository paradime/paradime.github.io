title: You're up and running!

You're up and running... this is where we all start. It's hard to start a blog when you're not really sure what
to write about. I guess the best place to start would be an introduction to myself but you can also find
something a little more exciting [here](/).

## Where I'm from
I grew up on Long Island, and I was there for the first 18 years of my life. As a young lad, I wanted to make games, but it slowly became apparent that making
video games like Super Mario 64 or Donkey Kong 64 was probably a little too specific. But it did incentivize me to
take some programming classes. I started with [MicroWorlds][microworlds], moving turtles around and making different coloured
squiggles. From there I made the move to AP computer science where Java was the language of choice. I made a program
that accepted roman numerals and output their numeric equivalents (and vice-versa), and that was the first time that this
programming stuff seemed impressive.

## Where I'm at
Currently I'm attending the Rochester Institute of Technology, studying Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Communications.
RIT's co-op program landed me a sweet job working at a startup in Columbus, Ohio called [CoverMyMeds][cmm].
Working as a web developer there has been both challenging and rewarding. I can say that I've never pushed myself
to work harder to keep up with my peers than I do here. In the brief 3 months working here, lessons in Ruby,
Rails, HTML, Javascript, and EmberJS have been a daily occurrence.

## Where I'm going
Information is one of the most powerful tools in our lives. It helps us decide when to put gas in our car,
when to wake up, how to better ourselves, etc. If you think about the boost in information that something like
Google has given us, you can slowly see threads of improvements in the overall quality of life for everyone on
the planet. It's more than just not having to go to the library and check out a book. Rather than heading to
the bookstore to browse cookbooks published only because they had the potential to make money for the publisher,
I can google what food I want to eat and easily find a recipe that was crafted by a food blogger who writes
because they love it, not because they want to make money.

I want to use the tools of manipulating information to improve the lives of as many people as possible. I
currently get that validation from working at CoverMyMeds. The knowledge that every prior authorization that is
submitted could have been a patient who went without the drugs they need is a powerful motivator. I'm currently
working on a tool that helps a physician or pharmacist chat with us so that we can effectively guide them through the process. It's possible that every time we chat with someone, there's a patient who receives their medication who wouldn't otherwise.

At the moment I feel that I can share a lot of the talents that I've gained working at CoverMyMeds to help
others with their problems. For every client I can guarantee that I will work my hardest to guarantee a realistic product
that is high quality, within budget, and on time.
