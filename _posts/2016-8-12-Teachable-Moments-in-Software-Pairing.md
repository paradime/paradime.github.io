title: Teachable Moments in Software Pairing
---

My last week at CoverMyMeds was a lot of fun. It was satisfying to have no
obligations to keep my hands in any pots. One of the benefits was being able to
work with a co-op on our team, Braden. Braden started a few months ago and
pairing in the office made me wish that I had spent more time pairing with him
since he started. Pairing with Braden reminded me of what it was like when I
first started, deer in the headlights, confused about everything going on. The
inspiration for this post started when he asked me to review his code, and that
led me down this rabbit hole.

It's pretty typical to get a hipchat message asking to have me review someones
code. I'm sure this happens to most developers. We look at it, send back our
comments, start a conversation, and inevitably, give it a :+1:. I was going to
do that again today; but, I got in early, I didn't have much on my agenda, I
told Braden I was going to review it with him. This allowed me to do more than
just review his code. I could give him insights on what I think about when
reviewing. What kinds of questions I ask myself, like "could this be
simplified?", "how clear and readable is this code?", "if this test failed,
would I be able to figure out what went wrong?", "is there any cases that don't
seem to be tested but should be?",
