# Learning from Video Games

## Hackbot inspiration

Recently I had the pleasure of playing Hackbot. Hackbot is a puzzle game designed to teach you the absolute basics of programming. It does a good job of introducing `if` statements as well as `loops` using `GoTo` statements. It's a really elementary game but would be an awesome introduction to kids who have never programmed before. The game is really colorful and cute and provides an awesome visual representation of how a computer works. I wanted to play this game because I wanted to play some puzzle games around programming because I was wondering if I could introduce them to kids that I teach at school and possibly enrich the Teals curriculum. Currently we use a similar game on the first day called [Light Bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbot) but it's pretty short and we never really reference the game itself later.

This posed 2 thoughts to me which inspired this post. The first is, wouldn't it be cool if we could use games as syllabus items in school? Similar to how you are required to read certain pieces of literature in an english class. How interesting would it be if you were a kid and you were assigned to play through the first section of a video game for homework?

The second thought I had was, games that I played as a kid were really just about having fun. This was great, I loved running around Princess Peach's castle in [Super Mario 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64) or exploring all of the nooks and crannies of the worlds in Gruntildas castle in [Banjo Kazooie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie_(video_game)). But as an adult, I feel a lot more protective of my time and when I read a book, watch a movie, or play a game, I really love it when I feel like I get something out of the experience. Tangentially, this is one of the main reasons why I loved the first season of [Westworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)) but could barely get through the second. I felt like I learned something philosophically about myself and the human condition in the first season but the second season left that behind and focused on character relationships.

I want to share some of the experiences that I've had recently with games that I've felt like I've actually gotten something out of other than a fun time. Specifically, I want to talk about moral decision making in [The Witcher 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt), the seesaw of introversion and extroversion of [Persona 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_4), and teamwork of [World of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft).

## The Witcher 3

I'll be honest, I know nothing about the source material of The Witcher series. My first introduction was to The Witcher 2 which I couldn't get into. I told myself when I started The Witcher 3, I would give it a good 5 hours before putting it down and man am I glad that I did that. The opening chapter of The Witcher 3 does not give the game justice to what tropes the game explores. I never particularly understood what drew people to the story of games because when I was a kid, games I played didn't really have good stories, or if they did, the stories were really a backdrop to the gameplay. In The Witcher 3, I found myself getting sucked into the story and there's a part very early on in the game that really made me understand how games can be an amazing medium for teaching about moral decision making.

In as few spoilers as possible, there's a part where you're in a swamp and the witches of said swamp tell you that you need to get rid of an evil presence that's killing the people of the swamp. They ask you to take care of it. So you go ahead and learn more about how this presence. Eventually you actually meet the presence which explains that it was actually trying to protect itself from the witches and it basically makes a case for it's existence. At this point you actually have to make the decision between two evils, help this presence out and team up with it, or complete your task given by the witches and defeat the presence. You have to choose what you hope is the lesser of two evils, there is no 'good' choice. 

I recently stumbled on a [Video by Avarti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkEwpDejRQk) on youtube that actually goes more in depth on this actual scene. He explains the outcome of both choices and uses this case as a way of using utilitarian philosophy for ethical problem solving. Note, this will fully spoil both decisions.

At this point I actually had to put the controller down and walk away and think about it. I genuinely weighed the pros and cons of this decision because I trust that the developers will respect my decision in some way. While I understand that this is just a basic decision tree that a 'pick your own adventure' book has explored for years, this felt much more real.

I understand that The Witcher comes from books and has been ported to a TV series each respecting the morally ambiguous dark themes. But those mediums are 'on rails'. You, as the participant never actually get to make the decisions, sometimes you don't even know that there was an alternate option. In video games, that option is literally shoved in your face and YOU will pay the penalties for that decision. This really gave me some respect for games as a medium for storytelling. 

The fact that the game will take almost 60 hours to complete makes me feel like the decision is effectively permanent and there's no taking it back. This is what I believe seperates a game from The Witcher and a similar piece of media, such as [Black Mirror's Bandersnatch](). Both focus on decision trees, but the fact that you can observe every branch in Bandersnatch in a 3 hour sitting diminishes the experience for me.

Now imagine that you were in an english class in high school and you had to play The Witcher 3 for homework. The next day you would all have a similar experience of the decision. You would be able to discuss HOW and WHY each person made the decision, and talk about the different consequences that came out of each decision. This game gives you the sandbox to understand and decide on morally grey decisions that are posed in life. Outside of philosophical thought experiments, which never actually require you to live with the consequences of your decision, I can't particularly think of another medium that can do that.

## Persona 4 Golden

## World of Warcraft

## Conclusion

At this point in the evolution of the art of video games, games, gaming culture, and game development have matured to a point where we can 'get things out of' video games to the same degree that we can 'get things out of' books, movies, or really good television series. It feels like 'guilt' is a big driver of people not playing games as adults because they feel as if they are a '[waste of time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_SkUqOVP-0)'. But I would ask you to think, has anyone ever told you that we shouldn't read books or watch movies because it's a 'waste of time'? If we reframe how we think about the games we play and why we play them, that 'guilt' fall off as we learn to appreciate games for what they are and not loathe them for what they're not.

This post was heavily inspired by a [presentation that legendary game designer, John Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWFScmtiC44), recently put up on youtube about using video games as an educational medium.
