What experience do you want from a game?

- Story
  - Story used to be the backdrop to rationalize gameplay
  - in my previous post I talked about how the story of Witcher 3 was a huge draw for me to play the game
  - Visual novels are this in the most pure form
  - DanganRonpa is probably the next level from that
  - Wanting to play a game for the story is an emergent property of games evolving from the RPG genre
    - the thing holding back pacman was the compelling story!
- Gameplay
  - you're playing the game for the fun of the game
  - Furi, Portal, Slay the Spire, Counter Strike, League of Legends
    - these are the 'gamer' games
  - your brain needs to be turned on and you are actively, thinking, planning or reacting to the game
  - these games succeed the most when you get into a state of flow
  - most roguelike games (before Hades) fall under this genre because there is no story and each run is 'live'
    - I haven't played a roguelite game that that expects grinding from the player
- Grinding
  - "mindless" or "turn your brain off" gameplay with an innevitable payoff at the end
  - payoffs include
    - new gameplay features
    - story beats
  - "knitting" experience
    - podcast or audiobook
  - ex. Leveling a second character in an mmo
    - you've already had the experience, 
    - payoff of having a new experience of playing the content with a different class
  - ex. Beating up easy enemies that aren't required to beat a dungeon
    - there is no challenge, in persona 5, there's even an auto vulnerability button
      - in DQ11 there is a complete auto battle feature
    - payoff is that the next challenge will be attainable or easier
    - a well tuned JRPG doesn't have need the EXCESS enemies to complete the boss
- Games can be in multiple lines
  - in DQ11, I found the most fun to be setting up my character's and 
    - then watching them beat up enemies of similar level without my help
    - But the Vignette story telling combined with an overall story arch was definitely the carrot that kept the gameplay loop from getting stale
      - story beat -> setup character -> grind to boss -> repeat
- Why is this important?
  - Besides just liking a genre or picking up the hottest new game, think about what kind of experience you'd like to have!
  - I've used grinding in WoW as a vehicle for listening to audiobooks as it can keep my hands busy while I knock out some chores for my character's power level which pays off when I want to do a difficult dungeon, raid, or pvp session.
  - When I want to just experience a story, I have leaned more towards persona 5 recently rather than booting up magic, hearthstone, or Legends of Runeterra
  - Backlogs can get really full and it's hard to resist the temptation of buying a new game without thinking about what experience this fulfills
  - FFXIV is story driven, but sometimes you just want a grind
  - Gameplay can become grind when you've experienced the same thing enough times that it's lost it's sheen
    - ex. I enjoyed the combat system of P4 and P5 less BECAUSE I played Octopath Traveler
      - They're not bad, but how many times can you solve the puzzle of 'craft the team with all the weakness breakers'
    - Progression treadmills that change up the gameplay in interesting ways keep things fresh
      - ex. Stardew Valley's day 1 is different from day 30 which is different from day 300, the gameplay evolves and your goals change but the foundational systems are still the
