## Intro

I would describe Atelier Ryza as a 'niche pick' for me. This series is pretty far from the mainstream western audiences privy*. I have heard good things about this iteration of the Atelier series mainly due to the dropping of its time constraints on quests and story. One thing that I had not heard was that the series up to this point had english dubbing and this was the first entry in the series to drop that dubbing so every scene was Japanese dubbing and english subtitles. 

*I think a good dipstick on whether a single player game is in the mainstream audience is whether or not a game has ever been featured in a games done quick. 
## Where is the fun?

Atelier Ryza is a charming game with interesting and engaging characters. I found myself really engaging with each character's storylines just a few hours into the game. In addition, crafting your own gear and items is a really satisfying gameplay loop that they built around. That being said, there are some really specific design decisions that got in the way of my enjoyment of the game.

## Gameplay

### Progression Systems

One of the most interesting parts of Atelier Ryza is it's Spiral Progression System. The idea behind this is that rather than moving from location A(I have never touched a sword in my home town) -> B -> C -> ... -> Z(killing god), Ryza slowly moves through the different progression systems. The formula is typically, get new power for system A, show you can use it, get new power for system B, show you can use it. This continues until you hit all systems then starts over again. What does this mean in real terms?

The 4 main systems are exploration, combat, gathering, and crafting. So an example gameplay loop will be: 
1. get a hammer
2. show the player the hammer can break rocks in the world
3. ask the player to go to a place that requires a hammer to get to
4. introduce the player to a new battle mechanic
5. Have the player use that mechanic in a sample battle
6. Ask the player to pick up some new item in this area that has enemies that need the battle mechanic to beat
7. Have the player use the crafted goods to make an item
8. Upon crafting the item, you learn how to make a bomb which can blow up bigger rocks than the hammer
9. repeat steps 1-8

This gives the player enough time to familiarize themselves with a new toy while constantly giving them a constant stream of small goals to work towards. This is a pretty genius way of 

### Combat

Combat is a very interesting take on an Active Time Battle system
